# GroceryPal Web API

- Rest API for working with Products, ShoppingList and Recipes.
- Additional functionality is finding the best route in the store based on the shopping list.
  - The store layout is presented as a graph, with the distances between the shelves and the freezers as the weights of the branches. AÂ distance matrix was created based on this graph using the Dijkstra algorithm. The best route through the store is determined using the Traveling Salesman Algorithm, which uses the distance matrix.
